Project goals:

1. To develop a campus navigation system that assists students in locating classrooms, laboratories, libraries, and offices using interactive maps.
2. To design a timetable management system with personalized schedules, class reminders, and real-time notifications for schedule changes.
3. To implement an AI-powered assistant using LLM and RAG for answering academic and campus-related queries accurately.

Quick start (local scaffold):
